## III. Vietnamese Stock Market Landscape & Regulatory Considerations

Operating within the Vietnamese stock market demands a thorough understanding of its unique regulatory framework and trading mechanisms. Adherence to these regulations is paramount for the system's operational integrity and legal compliance.

### Overview of HOSE and HNX Trading Rules

The Vietnamese stock exchanges, comprising the **Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE)** and the **Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX)**, operate Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays. Both exchanges have specific trading sessions and order types.

**HOSE Trading Hours and Order Types**:

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to submit orders during the Opening Call Auction (9:00 - 9:15) using ATO or LO orders, and know that no cancellation is allowed.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to submit orders during Continuous Order Matching I (9:15 - 11:30) using LO or MTL orders, and be able to cancel/amend them.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to pause order submission, amendment, or cancellation during Intermission (11:30 - 13:00).**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to submit orders during Continuous Order Matching II (13:00 - 14:30) using LO or MTL orders, and be able to cancel/amend them.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to submit orders during the Closing Call Auction (14:30 - 14:45) using ATC or LO orders, and know that no cancellation is allowed.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to support Put-through (Negotiated) Transactions during 9:00 - 11:30 and 13:00 - 14:45 (Intraday), and 14:45 - 15:00 (After-hours).**

**HNX Trading Hours and Order Types**:

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to submit orders during Continuous Order Matching I (9:00 - 11:30) using LO, MTL, MOK, or MAK orders, and be able to cancel/amend them.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to pause order submission, amendment, or cancellation during Intermission (11:30 - 13:00).**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to submit orders during Continuous Order Matching II (13:00 - 14:30) using LO, MTL, MOK, or MAK orders, and be able to cancel/amend them.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to submit orders during Closing Periodic Order Matching (14:30 - 14:45) using ATC or LO orders, and know that no amendment/cancellation is allowed.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to support Post-session Order Matching (14:45 - 15:00) using PLO orders, and know that no adjustment/cancellation is allowed.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to support Put-through Transactions during 9:00 - 11:30 and 13:00 - 14:45 (Intraday), and 14:45 - 15:00 (After-hours).**

**Order Type Definitions**:

  * **As a trading system user, I want to place a Limit Order (LO) to buy/sell at a specified price or better, effective until canceled or end of day.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want to place a Market-to-Limit (MTL) order to buy at the lowest offer/sell at the highest bid, with any unmatched volume converting to an LO.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want to place a Match-or-Kill (MOK) order to buy at the lowest offer/sell at the highest bid, with the entire order canceled if not entirely matched.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want to place a Match-and-Kill (MAK) order to buy at the lowest offer/sell at the highest bid, with any remaining unmatched volume canceled.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want to place an At-the-close (ATC) order to trade at the closing price, with higher priority than LO, and any unmatched volume canceled at session end.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want to place a Post-session Limit Order (PLO) to be executed at the closing price after trading hours, with no adjustment/cancellation allowed.**

The system must strictly adhere to these trading hours and order type characteristics, including the inability to cancel or amend orders during certain sessions or for specific order types. The **Order Management Service** will need to directly incorporate these rules into its logic to prevent rejected orders and ensure efficient trading.

### Price Limits and Circuit Breakers

Vietnamese stock exchanges impose price limits and circuit breakers to manage market volatility.

**Daily Price Range (Fluctuation Band)**:

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to enforce HOSE daily price limits of ±7% for ordinary stocks, closed-end fund certificates, and ETFs, and ±20% for newly listed/resuming stocks.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to enforce HNX daily price limits of ±10% for ordinary stocks and ETFs, and ±30% for newly listed/resuming stocks.**
  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to enforce UPCOM daily price limits of ±15% for ordinary stocks, and ±40% for newly listed/resuming stocks.**

**Circuit Breakers**:

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to detect and react instantaneously to market circuit breaker activations as determined by the SSC, halting trading or adjusting strategies as required.**

The system's risk management and order submission logic must be designed to react instantaneously to such halts, preventing erroneous orders and managing open positions.

### Settlement Cycle

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to account for a T+2 settlement cycle for stocks and fund certificates, and T+1 for bonds, ensuring accurate fund availability and position management.**

### Short Selling and Margin Trading

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to support covered short selling and intraday trading under regulated conditions, managing specialized accounts, collateral, and trading limits.**

### Foreign Ownership Limits (FOLs)

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to enforce Foreign Ownership Limits (FOLs) for specific stocks to prevent order rejections and ensure regulatory compliance.**

### Regulatory Oversight

  * **As a trading system user, I want the system to maintain robust logging and auditing mechanisms to demonstrate compliance with SSC regulations, especially for algorithmic and high-frequency trading.**

## IV. Microservice Architecture Design

The choice of a microservice architecture is fundamental to achieving the necessary performance, scalability, resilience, and maintainability for a sophisticated quantum trading system.

### Core Principles

The microservice architecture will adhere to several core principles:

  * **As a system administrator, I want each microservice to be modular and independently deployable to accelerate development and reduce deployment risks.**
  * **As a system developer, I want each service to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, focusing on a single business function for high cohesion.**
  * **As a system developer, I want services to interact through well-defined interfaces (loose coupling) to enhance resilience against individual service failures.**
  * **As a system developer, I want the architecture to support language agnosticism, allowing different services to use optimal languages if beneficial.**
  * **As a system administrator, I want individual teams to own and manage their services (decentralized governance) to foster agility and accountability.**

### Service Identification

The system will be decomposed into the following key microservices, each representing a bounded context within the trading domain:

  * **Portal Service**: This is the main user-facing application, typically a web application (e.g., built with a modern frontend framework) that aggregates functionalities from various backend microservices to provide a unified user experience. It acts as the primary entry point for users interacting with the trading system.
  * **SSO Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization. It provides single sign-on capabilities, allowing users to log in once and access multiple services without re-authenticating. It handles user registration, login, password management, and token issuance (e.g., JWT).
  * **SSO-UI Service**: A dedicated lightweight user interface specifically for SSO-related processes. This might be a separate frontend application for login forms, registration pages, password reset flows, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) setup, integrating directly with the SSO Service.
  * **Order Management Service**: This critical service integrates with the SSI FastConnect FC Trading API for **order placement, modification, and cancellation**. It manages order history and queries maximum buy/sell quantities, balances, and positions. It handles authentication (access token, OTP, verify code) and adheres to rate limits.
  * **Market Data Ingestion Service**: Responsible for connecting to the SSI FastConnect FC Data API, receiving real-time market data (tick data, OHLC, order book, indices, foreign room, security status). It handles parsing, validation, and initial storage of the data. **This service will operate during market hours: 9:00 - 11:30 and 13:00 - 15:00.**
  * **Historical Data Service**: Manages the storage and retrieval of historical market data, providing a robust dataset for backtesting, model training, and long-term analysis.
  * **Technical Analysis Service**: Consumes real-time and historical data to compute various technical indicators and patterns.
  * **Prediction Service**: Uses advanced models to forecast market movements.
  * **Decision Engine Service**: Determines optimal trading actions based on predictions and strategies.
  * **Master Data Service**: Acts as the authoritative source of truth for static and semi-static reference data, such as security master data (code, name, type, exchange), company fundamentals, and trading rules (tick sizes, lot sizes, trading hours, circuit breaker thresholds).
  * **Risk Management Service**: Monitors and controls trading risks.
  * **Notification Service**: Manages alerts and notifications.
  * **Logging and Monitoring Service**: Provides comprehensive system observability.
  * **Rule Service**: Manages and executes a set of predefined business rules. These rules can be dynamic and configurable, allowing for flexible strategy adjustments, compliance checks, or operational logic without code changes. It can be called by other services (e.g., Decision Engine, Risk Management) to apply specific conditions or actions.
  * **Memory LLM Service**: Integrates a large language model (LLM) to perform advanced natural language processing tasks. This could include analyzing news sentiment, summarizing financial reports, answering complex queries, or even generating insights from unstructured data. It acts as a specialized AI inference service.
  * **Analyze Emotion Service**: Dedicated to sentiment analysis from various data sources (e.g., social media feeds, news articles, investor forums). It can gauge market sentiment and emotional trends, providing an additional input signal for the Decision Engine or Prediction Service.
  * **Config Service**: Provides a centralized store for application configurations. This ensures that environmental settings, feature flags, and other parameters can be managed and updated dynamically without redeploying individual services, promoting agility and consistency across the microservices landscape. **The Config Service will also be responsible for managing and providing access tokens for SSI FastConnect APIs (both Data and Trading).**

### Communication Patterns

Effective communication between microservices is crucial for achieving performance and resilience. A hybrid approach incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous patterns will be employed:

  * **As a system developer, I want synchronous communication (gRPC/REST) for real-time request-response interactions where an immediate reply is needed, such as order submission or master data queries, preferring gRPC for performance.**
  * **As a system developer, I want asynchronous communication (Message Queues like Kafka) for high-throughput data streams, event-driven processes, and decoupling services, prioritizing Kafka for market data streaming.**

**Communication Component Service Diagram (ASCII Art)**

            +--------------------------------------->
    Kafka Broker (Topic: market.data.raw)
            <---------------------------------------+
```

### Data Management per Service

  * **As a system developer, I want each microservice to maintain its own data store for isolation and autonomy.**
  * **As a data engineer, I want Time-Series Databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB/QuestDB) for storing high-frequency real-time and historical market data.**
  * **As a data engineer, I want a Relational Database (PostgreSQL) for structured master data and transactional data (order history, balances, configs, rules).**
  * **As a system administrator, I want Redis for in-memory caching, rate limiting, and session management to enhance performance.**
  * **As a system developer, I want the Master Data Service to act as the authoritative source of truth for critical reference data, ensuring consistency.**

### API Design and Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

  * **As a system developer, I want APIs to be designed with a design-first approach using OpenAPI Specification (OAS) for clear definition and consistency, specifically for all backend components.**
  * **As a system developer, I want consistent design styles and reusable components across all microservices.**
  * **As a system developer, I want every component service to expose its API documentation via Swagger UI.**
  * **As a system developer, I want request and response models to be defined using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), leveraging FastAPI's Pydantic for strict data validation and clear data samples.**
  * **As a system developer, I want all incoming data to be strictly validated at API boundaries.**

### 2\. Agent Collaboration History

  * **As a system, I want a dedicated `agent_history/` directory at the project root to store overall summaries and any entirely new code files generated by an AI agent.**
  * **As an AI agent, I want to save newly generated code files (e.g., a completely new service) within `agent_history/code/` in a timestamped, task-specific subdirectory (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_task_XX_description/`).**
  * **As an AI agent, I want to create a markdown file within `agent_history/summaries/` for each task, with a clear description of what was done, key decisions, and any relevant context.**
  * **As an AI agent, for specific component modifications, I want to store generated or modified code snippets/files within the `services/COMPONENT_NAME/agent_changes/` directory, also in a timestamped, task-specific subdirectory.**
  * **As an AI agent, I want to be able to read previous summary files from `agent_history/summaries/` and the `agent_changes/` folders within individual services to understand past work, project context, and continue development seamlessly on new tasks.**
  * **As a human developer, I want to review `agent_history/` and `services/*/agent_changes/` to understand the agent's contributions and reasoning.**

## X. Project Phasing and Incremental Development

The project will be developed and delivered in three distinct phases, building upon each other. Each phase will introduce new capabilities while ensuring seamless integration with previous functionalities and allowing for flexible trading "modes."

### 1\. Phase 1: Technical Analysis Driven Trading

  * **Core Capability**: Focus on leveraging the **Technical Analysis Service** to generate trading signals based on various technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and chart patterns.
  * **Services Involved**: Market Data Ingestion, Historical Data Service, Technical Analysis Service, Order Management Service, Risk Management Service, Master Data Service, Config Service, Rule Service, Portal Service, SSO Services.
  * **Integration**: The Decision Engine will primarily use outputs from the Technical Analysis Service to make trading decisions.
  * **Trading Mode**: Users can select a "Technical Analysis Mode" where strategies are executed purely based on predefined technical rules and signals. This forms the foundational automated trading capability.
  * **Goal**: Achieve stable, rule-based automated trading with robust technical analysis.

### 2\. Phase 2: Machine Learning & Deep Learning Enhanced Trading

  * **Core Capability**: Introduce advanced predictive models using **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** within the **Prediction Service** to forecast market movements and enhance signal generation.
  * **Services Involved**: All services from Phase 1, plus the Prediction Service.
  * **Integration**: The Decision Engine will now consume signals from both the Technical Analysis Service and the Prediction Service. ML/DL models will provide more sophisticated, data-driven insights. The system should allow the Decision Engine to prioritize or combine signals from these two sources.
  * **Trading Mode**: A "ML/DL Hybrid Mode" will be available, enabling trading strategies that incorporate predictive analytics alongside traditional technical analysis. The system should allow for configuration to determine the weight or priority given to ML/DL signals.
  * **Goal**: Improve trading performance and adaptability through intelligent, data-driven predictions.

### 3\. Phase 3: Large Language Model (LLM) Integrated Trading

  * **Core Capability**: Integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through the **Memory LLM Service** and **Analyze Emotion Service** to incorporate unstructured data (news sentiment, social media, reports) into the decision-making process.
  * **Services Involved**: All services from Phase 2, plus Memory LLM Service, Analyze Emotion Service.
  * **Integration**: The Decision Engine will now consider sentiment and contextual insights derived from LLMs and emotion analysis. This adds a qualitative, macro-level understanding to quantitative signals. The system must ensure that the LLM inputs are processed efficiently and integrated without causing latency or instability.
  * **Trading Mode**: An "LLM Enhanced Mode" will be introduced, allowing strategies to factor in real-time news sentiment and broader market narratives generated by LLMs, creating a more holistic trading approach. The system should allow users to configure the influence of LLM-derived signals on trading decisions.
  * **Goal**: Achieve a comprehensive, intelligent trading system that combines technical, quantitative, and qualitative insights for superior decision-making.

### Incremental Integration and Mode Selection

  * **Seamless Integration**: Each phase will be developed to integrate seamlessly with the existing functionalities from previous phases. This means services developed in earlier phases will be designed to be extensible and compatible with new data sources and signal types introduced in later phases without requiring major refactoring or causing errors.
  * **Backward Compatibility**: All APIs and data schemas will be versioned and designed for backward compatibility to ensure that older components or strategies continue to function as new ones are introduced.
  * **Configurable Trading Modes**: The Decision Engine will implement a mechanism to allow "mode selection." This will enable users or automated processes to switch between different trading strategies or decision-making paradigms (e.g., purely technical analysis, ML-driven, or LLM-enhanced). This could be managed via the Config Service, allowing for dynamic changes in the active trading strategy. This ensures flexibility and allows for testing and deployment of advanced capabilities without disrupting existing, stable strategies.

## XI. User Interface (UI) Guidelines
For components within the system that feature a user interface, the following guidelines will be adhered to to ensure an optimal user experience and maintain a consistent, modern aesthetic:

Lightweight Design: UI components must be designed to be as lightweight as possible to ensure fast loading times and smooth performance, especially crucial in a system where quick access to information is vital.

Bootstrap Framework: The Bootstrap framework will be utilized for its robust, mobile-first, and responsive design capabilities. This will provide a solid foundation for consistent styling and a wide array of pre-built components.

Responsive Layout: All UI elements must be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones) to ensure accessibility and usability across different platforms.

Aesthetic CSS, HTML, and JavaScript: Emphasis will be placed on creating visually appealing interfaces with clean, well-structured CSS and HTML. JavaScript will be used efficiently to enhance interactivity and dynamic content without compromising performance. The design should be modern and intuitive, facilitating easy navigation and data interpretation.
