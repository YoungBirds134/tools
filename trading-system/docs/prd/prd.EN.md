### 2.3. Epic: Real-time Risk Management
* **User Story:** As Riley, I want to monitor the system's real-time risk exposure and have automated controls in place so that I can protect the firm's capital and maintain compliance.

* **Functional Requirements:**
    1.  **Pre-Trade Risk Checks:** The system **must** synchronously check every order against the following before it is sent to the exchange:
        * Maximum order value and quantity limits.
        * Maximum position limits per instrument.
        * Account available capital and margin.
        * Foreign Ownership Limit (FOL) availability.
        Orders violating these checks **must** be rejected internally with a clear reason.
    2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** The system **must** provide a dashboard displaying:
        * Real-time P&L for each position and the overall portfolio.
        * Current market exposure (long/short positions).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### 3.1. Performance
* **P99 Latency:**
    * **Market Data Ingestion:** < 50ms from SSI API to internal Kafka topic.
    * **Order Execution:** < 100ms from internal decision to exchange acknowledgement.
* **Throughput:** The system must be able to process at least 10,000 market data messages per second without performance degradation.

### 3.2. Reliability & Availability
* **Uptime:** The system must achieve **99.99%** uptime during Vietnamese stock market trading hours.
* **Data Integrity:** There must be **zero data loss** for all order-related events and market data ticks. The Market Data Ingestion Service's design with a local persistent buffer and `acks=all` is critical to this NFR.
* **Fault Tolerance:** The failure of any single service should not cause a cascading failure of the entire system. Core trading functionality must persist even if auxiliary services (e.g., Notification) are down.

### 3.3. Scalability
* The architecture must support horizontal scaling. Each microservice must be scalable independently to handle a 5x increase in load (e.g., market data volume, number of active strategies) without requiring a re-architecture.

### 3.4. Security
* All API endpoints (internal and external) must be secured.
* All sensitive data (API keys, secrets, tokens) must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
* The system must comply with all State Securities Commission (SSC) regulations regarding algorithmic trading systems and data security.

## 4. User Interface & Experience (UX)
* The primary user interfaces will be dashboards for Risk Management and System Operations.
* All UIs will adhere to the guidelines specified in the technical design:
    * Built on the **Bootstrap** framework.
    * **Lightweight** and fast-loading.
    * Fully **responsive** for desktop, tablet, and mobile access.
    * The design will be clean, modern, and intuitive, prioritizing clear data visualization.

## 5. Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies
* **Assumptions:**
    * The SSI FastConnect API is stable, and its performance is within its documented SLAs.
    * The market data provided by the API is accurate.
* **Constraints:**
    * The system must operate entirely within the legal and regulatory framework of the Vietnamese State Securities Commission (SSC) and the Ministry of Finance.
    * The system must strictly adhere to the API rate limits imposed by SSI.
* **Dependencies:**
    * The system is **100% dependent** on the SSI FastConnect API for market data and trade execution. A failure of this external API will result in a loss of trading capability.

---

## 6. Future Work (Out of Scope for v1.0)
* Integration with other brokerage APIs in Vietnam.
* Expansion to other asset classes (e.g., derivatives).
* A graphical user interface for building and defining trading strategies ("no-code" strategy builder).
* Advanced portfolio optimization modules based on risk parity or other models.
