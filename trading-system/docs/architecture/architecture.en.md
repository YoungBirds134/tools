3. Core Principles of Microservice ArchitectureThe architecture adheres to the following core principles:Modularity and Independent Deployability: Each microservice is designed to be modular and independently deployable, allowing for faster development cycles and reduced deployment risks.Single Responsibility Principle: Each service focuses on a single business function, ensuring high cohesion and clear boundaries.Loose Coupling: Services interact through well-defined interfaces (APIs), enhancing resilience against individual service failures.Language Agnosticism: The architecture supports the use of different programming languages for different services, allowing teams to choose the optimal language for a specific task if beneficial.Decentralized Governance: Individual teams own and manage their services, fostering agility and accountability.4. Service Identification and ResponsibilitiesThe system is decomposed into the following key microservices, each with distinct responsibilities:Portal Service: The main user-facing web application that aggregates functionalities from various backend microservices, providing a unified user experience (dashboard, order entry, portfolio, reports).SSO Service: Manages user authentication and authorization, providing single sign-on capabilities, user registration, login, password management, and token issuance (e.g., JWT).SSO-UI Service: A dedicated lightweight user interface specifically for SSO-related processes like login forms, registration pages, and password reset flows.Order Management Service: Integrates with the SSI FastConnect FC Trading API for order placement, modification, and cancellation. It manages order history, queries maximum buy/sell quantities, balances, and positions, and handles 2FA.Market Data Ingestion Service: Connects to the SSI FastConnect FC Data API for real-time data streaming (WebSockets), parsing, validating, timestamping, enriching, and publishing data to Kafka topics. Operates during market hours.Historical Data Service: Manages the storage and retrieval of historical market data, fetching daily and intraday OHLCV data, and index data from SSI FastConnect REST APIs.Technical Analysis Service: Consumes real-time and historical data to compute various technical indicators (SMAs, EMAs, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and identify chart/candlestick patterns.Prediction Service: Utilizes advanced models, including quantum-inspired algorithms on classical hardware, and diverse machine learning models (Deep Learning, Gradient Boosting, Reinforcement Learning) for forecasting market movements.Decision Engine Service: Determines optimal trading actions based on predictions, technical signals, sentiment, and predefined strategies, generating trade recommendations or triggering order submissions.Master Data Service: Acts as the authoritative source of truth for static and semi-static reference data (security master data, company fundamentals, trading rules), sourced from SSI APIs or internal UI.Risk Management Service: Monitors and controls trading risks by performing pre-trade checks, monitoring real-time market exposure, handling circuit breakers, enforcing stop-loss/take-profit levels, and monitoring margin utilization.Notification Service: Manages alerts and notifications, subscribing to Kafka topics for key events (order status, risk alerts, system errors) and delivering notifications via various channels (email, SMS, chat).Logging and Monitoring Service: Provides comprehensive system observability by aggregating logs, collecting performance metrics, implementing distributed tracing, and configuring alerts.Rule Service: Centralizes the management and execution of dynamic business rules, allowing for flexible strategy adjustments and compliance checks without code changes in other services.Memory LLM Service: Integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform advanced natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, financial news summarization, and query answering from textual data.Analyze Emotion Service: Dedicated to sentiment analysis from various data sources (e.g., social media feeds, news articles, investor forums) to gauge market sentiment and emotional trends.Config Service: Provides a centralized store for application configurations, including API keys and feature flags, and manages access tokens for SSI FastConnect APIs.5. Communication PatternsEffective communication between microservices is achieved through a hybrid approach:Synchronous Communication (gRPC/REST): Used for real-time request-response interactions where an immediate reply is needed, such as order submission, master data queries, or authentication. gRPC is preferred for its performance benefits.Asynchronous Communication (Message Queues like Kafka): Employed for high-throughput data streams, event-driven processes, and decoupling services. Kafka is prioritized for real-time market data streaming and broadcasting order status updates.Communication Component Service Diagram:+-------------------------+             +--------------------------+

6. Data Management per ServiceEach microservice maintains its own data store for isolation and autonomy, promoting independent development and deployment.Time-Series Databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB/QuestDB): Used for storing high-frequency real-time and historical market data, optimized for time-series queries.Relational Database (PostgreSQL): Employed for structured master data and transactional data, such as order history, balances, configurations, and rules.In-Memory Cache (Redis): Utilized for in-memory caching, rate limiting, and session management to enhance performance and reduce database load.Master Data Service: Acts as the authoritative source of truth for critical reference data, ensuring consistency across the system.7. API Design and DocumentationA design-first approach using OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is adopted for all backend components to ensure clear definition and consistency.OpenAPI Specification (OAS): APIs are defined using OAS for clear contracts and consistency across services.Consistent Design Styles: Reusable components and consistent design styles are maintained across all microservices.Swagger UI: Every component service exposes its API documentation via Swagger UI for easy exploration and understanding.Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Request and response models are defined using DTOs, leveraging FastAPI's Pydantic for strict data validation and clear data samples.Strict Input Validation: All incoming data is strictly validated at API boundaries to ensure data integrity and security.Automatic Documentation Generation: API documentation is automatically generated and updated to reflect code changes.8.
